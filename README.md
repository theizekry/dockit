**# Dockit** is a developer-friendly CLI tool that helps you quickly scaffold and manage Docker-based services (like PHP, MySQL, Nginx, etc.) in your local development environment — with zero hassle.

- Add services with proper configuration
- Generate Docker Compose files in seconds

## Why to use Dockit CLI

**Starting a new project often means hunting down old Docker Compose files, remembering service versions, copying configs from previous local projects, or digging through GitHub repos. Dockit eliminates that repetitive setup pain by offering a guided workflow to build your stack from scratch — or even add new services to your dockit to use them in the future.**

## Installation

Install Dockit globally with `pip`:

```bash
pip install dockit-cli
```

Or With pipx (recommended for macOS/Linux)
```
pipx install dockit-cli
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker installed and running


## Usage

This will walk you through setting up a new Docker environment with the services you choose.
